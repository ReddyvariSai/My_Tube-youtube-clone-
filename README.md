# YouTube-Clone — Project Overview (May–June 2025)

A responsive, security-minded YouTube-style frontend built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** as a personal project. The prototype demonstrates core video-platform features (video gallery, playback, search, comments, and basic auth) and integrates AI-powered enhancements (auto-captioning, short summaries, metadata/tag suggestions) along with Google platform tools (OAuth sign-in and YouTube Data API for demo metadata). The project focused on practical, client-side security: Content Security Policy, input sanitization to prevent XSS, secure token handling, and a deployment checklist for safe production usage.
